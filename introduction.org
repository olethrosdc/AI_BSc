* Introduction

** About the course  
*** Aims
This course will focus on algorithms and models for Artificial
Intelligence.  We will concentrate mainly on the decision making,
rather than the learning, side of artificial intelligence. Learning is
already addressed in statistics courses, as well as the machine
learning course in the final year.

*** Philosophy
The philosophy of this course is as follows: 
- We give example problems.
- We use theory to explain and generalise from those examples to general problems.
- We describe algorithms to /solve/ general problems.
- We implement algorithms to solve the specific examples.

In general, the course will start from the simplest problems and
slowly progress to the more complex ones.

** What is Artificial Intelligence?
*** Intelligence
**** What makes something intelligent?
- Thoughts?
- Behaviour?
**** Why do we need artificial intelligence?
- To do something a human can do (better? worse?)
- To do something a human cannot do?
- To help humans do something more efficiently?

*** Decisions and learning
**** Algorithms as thoughts
- Incorporating new information
- Deciding what to do.

**** Learning: Using information to update knowledge.
- Situational awareness: what is going on right now?
- Epistemic knowledge: How does the world work.
**** Decision making and interaction
- Recommend a route.
- Buy and sell stocks.
- Make a move in chess.
*** To the moon!
Goal: See if humans can live on the moon.
**** Learning
- Orbital mechanics: What are the equations of motion?
- Trajectory following: Where is the spaceship right now?
**** Decisions
- How much should we spend?
- How much payload/fuel/time?
- What is a good trajectory for a given payload/fuel?
- How can the spaceship follow the trajectory?
- How can the spaceship land on the moon?
*** The view from statistics  
**** Optimal decisions
- Problem-dependent
- Require defining a cost- or utility function
- The optimal solution has the lowest cost or maximal utility

**** Optimisation: algorithms for optimal solutions
- Discrete optimisation.
- Linear optimisation.
- Non-linear optimisation.

**** Statistics and Machine Learning
- How to learn from data and interactions.
- Summarising knowledge into a model.
- Using the knowledge to make decisions.

* The agent and the environment
** The agent and the environment
*** Agent-environment interface
**** Agent
- Obtains stimuli/observations $x_t$
- Generates actions/decisions $a_t$
**** Environment
- Reacts to agent's actions
- Generates observations
**** The mind/body interface
- The body can be seen as part of the mind's environment
**** Policy and history
- The agent's next action $a_{t+1}$ depends on previous observation's and actions.
- The policy is implemented through an *algorithm*
*** Examples
- Mazes
- Algebraic manipulation
- Chess game
- Poker game
- City driving
- Navigation assistant
- Space exploration

** Environments
*** Environment components
We generally consider dynamic environments, so at time $t$:
- $s_t$: state of the environment
- $x_t$: observation of the environment by the agent
- $a_t$: actions taken by the agent
**** Example: Mazes
- $s_t$: the location of the agent in the maze
- $x_t$: What the agent observes (exact location, or just surroundings?)
- $a_t$: Direction in which the agent moves

** Policies
*** Policies
- Policies determine the behaviour of the agent.
- They define what the agent does at any given time.
**** Reactive policies
We allow agents to randomise. The simplest agent choose actions only depending on the current observation:
\[
\pi(a_t | x_t) \tag{the probability with which the agent takes action $a_t$}
\]
**** Deterministic (reactive) policies
Then for each $x_t$ the same action $f(x_t)$ is always taken, so that $\pi(a_t = f(x_t) | x_t) = 1$.
**** Adaptive policies
The action taken may change over time, depending on what happened in the past:
\[
\pi(a_t \mid x_t, a_{t-1}, x_{t-1}, \ldots, a_1, x_1)
\]
*** Example policies
**** Reactive maze policy
- Ordered actions $A = \{\textrm{Up}, \textrm{Right}, \textrm{Down}, \textrm{Left}\}$
- Take action $a_{t+1} = a_t$ unless there is a wall in front.
- If there is a wall, take the next action, $a_{t+1} = a_t + 1$. (where + cycles over the 4 actions)

**** Problems with this policy
- Can it solve any maze?
- Why yes/no?
- What can we do to make sure that the agent visits every point of the maze?

** Agent structures
*** Example: taking an exam
**** High-level policy
- Study for exam
- Prepare exam materials
- Get to exam on time
- Write 
**** Mid-level policy for getting to the exam:
- Check starting time.
- Check location.
- Select transport option
- Set alarm clock.
- Go to the exam.
**** Low-level policy: Go to the exam.
- Get dressed
- Pick up things
- Get transport
- Go to exam room.
**** Reactive policy: Go to exam room
- Navigate to the exam room.
- Move feet, don't fall down.
- Look around to avoid obstacles.
**** Autonomous policy
- Breathe with lungs.
- Pump blood with heart.

*** Example: Planning a trip
There are three train routes from Neuchatel to Luzerne 
- Neuchatel 6:58-IC-7:57 Olten 8:07-RE-8:55 Luzern (18 CHF)
- Neuchatel 7:01-S-7:52 Bern  8:00-IR-9:01 Luzern (22 CHF)
- Neuchatel 7:26-IC-8:18 Olten 8:30-IR-9:05 Luzern (26 CHF)
**** Criteria for choosing
- Price
- Train type
- Crowdedness
- Length of time
**** Planning the trip
- Is "go through Bern" enough of a plan?
- What about delays or cancellations?
**** Multiple levels of actions 
- Which route to use, and fallbacks.
- What to pack
- How to get to the station
- Putting one foot in front of the other.
*** Hierarchical control
**** High-level plan

**** Low-level control

*** Learning and memory
**** Belief state
- Memory
- A summary of the agent's knowledge
- The state in a state machine
- The contents of the tape and read/write heads on a Turing machien.
**** Belief transitions
- A (possibly randomised) function $f : B \times A \times X \to B$ 
\[
b_{t+1} = f(b_t, a_t, x_t)
\]
- $b_t \in S$: Belief at time $t$.
- $a_t \in A$: Action at time $t$
- $x_t \in X$: Observation at time $t$.
- $f$ is implemented by the agent's algorithm



* Designing agents
** Goals
*** Goals as a design principle
- Easy to define
- Can be too vague.
**** Example: mazes
- Assign "goal" to a maze location
- The agent should find the way to the goal.
**** Example: exams
- Goal: pass the exam
- The agent should find a strategy so that it passes the exam!

** Utilities
*** Utility as a design principle
- Hard to define.
- Can be too specific.
**** Example: mazes
- Prefer shortest path to longer ones to the goal.
- More complicated if we have intermediate goals.
**** Example: exams
- Prefer higher grades than lower grades.
- Prefer to study less than more



** Elementary Decision Theory
*** Preferences
**** Types of rewards                                               :example:
- For e.g. a student: Tickets to concerts.
- For e.g. an investor: A basket of stocks, bonds and currency.
- For everybody: Money.

**** Preferences among rewards
For any rewards $x, y \in R$, we either
- (a) Prefer $x$ at least as much as $y$ and write $x \preceq^* y$.
- (b) Prefer $x$ not more than $y$ and write $x \succeq^* y$.
- (c) Prefer $x$ about the same as $y$ and write $x \eqsim^* y$.
- (d) Similarly define $\succ^*$ and $\prec^*$
  
*** Utility and Cost
**** Utility function
To make it easy, assign a utility $U(x)$ to every reward through a
utility function $U : R \to \Reals$.

**** Utility-derived preferences
We prefer items with higher utility, i.e.
- (a) $U(x) \geq U(y)$ $\Leftrightarrow$ $x \succeq^* y$
- (b) $U(x) \leq U(y)$ $\Leftrightarrow$ $y \succeq^* x$

**** Cost
     It is sometimes more convenient to define a cost function $C: R \to \Reals$ so that we prefer items with lower cost, i.e.
- $C(x) \geq C(y)$ $\Leftrightarrow$ $y \succeq^* x$

**** Decision making as an optimisation problem
How can we find the decision maximising utility / minimising cost?

*** Choice of the utility function
**** Designer input
- The AI designer selects the utility (or goals)
- The choice is not always obvious!
**** The *value-alignment* problem
- The designer selects a utility they *think* is the best choice
- However, their choice results in unintended behaviour
- Example: Autonomous vehicles

**** The value-alignment in *populations*
- Not everybody wants the same thing.
- We need to design *fair* policies.

** Discussion
*** Goals versus preferences
**** Maze-solving
- How should we define the utility/cost of every path?
- Is an additive utility sufficient?

**** Exam taking
- What if you say you want to perform super-well in the exam?
- How can set up the decision problem of how to study for the exam?

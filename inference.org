** Set theory and logic
*** Set theory
- First, consider some universal set $\Omega$.
- A set $A$ is a collection of points $x$ in $\Omega$.
- $\{x \in \Omega : f(x)\}$: the set of points in $\Omega$ with the property that $f(x)$ is true.

**** Unary operators
- $\neg A =  \{x \in \Omega : x \notin A\}$.
**** Binary operators
- $A \cup B$ if $\{x \in \Omega : x \in A \vee x \in B\}$ - (c.f. $A \vee B$)
- $A \cap B$ if $\{x \in \Omega : x \in A \wedge x \in B\}$ - (c.f. $A \wedge B$)
**** Binary relations
- $A \subset B$ if $x \in A \Rightarrow x \in B$ - (c.f. $A \implies B$)
- $A = B$ if $x \in A \Leftrightarrow x \in B$ - (c.f. $A \Leftrightarrow B$)

** Logical inference
*** The inference problem

- Given statements $A_1, \ldots, A_n$ we know to be true (i.e. a knowledge base), is another statement $B$ true?

The following statements are equivalent:
- $A \implies B$ iff $(A \cap \neg B) = \emptyset$.
- $A \implies B$ iff $A \subset B$.

In addition
- If $(A \Rightarrow B ) \wedge A$ then $B$.
- If $(A \wedge B)$ then $A$.

* Probability background
  #+TOC: headlines [currentsection]
** Probability facts
*** Events as sets
**** The universe and random outcomes
- The $\Omega$ contains all events that can happen.
- When something happens, we observe an  element $\omega \in \Omega$.
**** Events in the universe
- An event is true if $\omega \in A$, and false if $\omega \notin A$.
- The negative event $\neg A = \Omega \setminus A$ is the set
- The possible events are a collection of subsets $\Sigma$ of $\Omega$ so that
(i) $\Omega \in \Sigma$, (ii) $A, B \in \Sigma \Rightarrow A \cup B in \Sigma$ (iii) $A \in \Sigma \Rightarrow \neg A \in \Sigma$
**** Example: Traffic violation
- A car is moving with speed $\omega \in [0,\infty)$ in front of the speed camera.
- $A_0 = [0,50]$: below the speed limit
- $A_1 = (50,60]$: low fine
- $A_2 = (60,\infty]$: high fine
- $A_3 = (100, \infty)$: Suspension of license
- All combinations of the above events are interesting.
*** Probability fundamentals

**** Probability measure $P$
Probability can be seen as an area-like function assigning a likelihood to sets.
- $P : \Sigma \to [0,1]$  gives the likelihood $P(A)$ of an event $A \in \Sigma$.
- $P(\Omega) = 1$
- For $A, B \subset \Omega$, if $A \cap B = \emptyset$ then $P(A \cup B) = P(A) + P(B)$.
**** Marginalisation
If $A_1, \ldots, A_n \subset \Omega$ are a partition of $\Omega$
\[
P(B) = \sum_{i = 1}^n P(B \cap A_i).
\]

** Conditional probability and independence
*** Conditional probability
**** Conditional probability
    :PROPERTIES:
    :BEAMER_env: definition
    :END:
The conditional probability of an event $A$ given an event $B$ is defined as 
\[
P(A | B) \defn \frac{P(A \cap B)}{P(B)}
\]
The above definition requires $P(B)$ to exist and be positive.

**** Conditional probabilities as a collection of probabilities
More generally, we can define conditional probabilities as simply a
collection of probability distributions:
\[
\{P_\param : \theta \in \Param\},
\]
where $\Param$ is indexing possible values of $\theta$.
-  $\theta$ is sometimes called the *model* or *parameter*

*** The theorem of Bayes
**** Bayes's theorem
    :PROPERTIES:
    :BEAMER_env: theorem
    :END:
\[
P(A | B) = \frac{P(B | A) P(A)}{P(B)} 
\]
#+BEAMER: \pause

**** The general case
If $A_1, \ldots, A_n$ are a partition of $\Omega$, meaning that they
are mutually exclusive events (i.e. $A_i \cap A_j = \emptyset$ for $i
\neq j$) such that one of them must be true (i.e. $\bigcup_{i=1}^n A_i =
\Omega$), then
\[
P(B) = \sum_{i=1}^n P(B | A_i) P(A_i)
\]
and 
\[
P(A_j | B) = \frac{P(B | A_j)}{\sum_{i=1}^n P(B | A_i) P(A_i)}
\]

** Posterior distributions and model estimation
*** Bayes's theorem
**** As a conditional measure
\[
P(A \mid B)
= 
\frac{P(B \mid A) P(A)}{P(B)}
= 
\frac{P(B \mid A) P(A)}{P(B \mid A) P(A) + P(B \mid \neg A) P(\neg A)}
\]

#+BEAMER: \pause
**** As a causal explanation
\[
\Pr(\textrm{cause} \mid \textrm{effect})
= 
\frac{\Pr(\textrm{effect} \mid \textrm{cause}) \Pr(\textrm{cause})}{\Pr(\textrm{effect})}
\]
#+BEAMER: \pause
**** As model inference
- Prior $\bel(\param)$
- Model class $\{P_\param(\bel) : \param \in \Param\}$
- Data $x$
\[
\bel(\param \mid x)
= 
\frac{P_\param(x) \bel(\param)}{\Pr_\bel(x)}
= 
\frac{P_\param(x) \bel(x)}{\sum_{\param' \in \Param} P_{\param'}(x) \bel(\param')}
\]


*** Independence
**** Independent events $A \indep B$
$A, B$ are *independent* iff $P(A \cap B) = P(A) P(B)$.
**** Conditional independence $A \indep B \mid C$
 $A, B$ are *conditionally independent* given $C$ iff $P(A \cap B | C) = P(A | C) P(B | C)$.

*** Example: Naive Bayes models
Sometimes we observe multiple effects that have a common cause, but which are otherwise independent:
\[
\Pr(\textrm{effect}_1, \ldots \textrm{effect}_n \mid \textrm{cause})
=
\prod_{i=1}^n \Pr(\textrm{effect}_i \mid \textrm{cause})
\]
**** Naive Bayes model
- Observations $(\bx_t, y_t)_{t=1}^T$ with $\bx_t = (x_{t,1}, \ldots, x_{t,n})$.
- Probability *models* $P_\param(y \mid \bx) = \prod_{i=1}^n P_\param(y \mid x_i)$.
*** Conditional independence

For any set of events $A_1, A_2, A_3, \ldots$, we can write their co-occurence probability as
$\prod_i P(A_i  \mid \cap A_1 \cap A_2 \cap \cdots \cap A_{i-1})$. However,
we can use a *Bayesian network* to define conditional independence structures.
**** Bayesian Network
:PROPERTIES:
:BEAMER_col: 0.5
:END:
    \begin{tikzpicture}
      \node[RV] at (0,0) (A1) {$A_1$};
      \node[RV] at (0,1) (A2) {$A_2$};
      \node[RV] at (1,0.5) (B) {$B$};
      \node[RV] at (2,0) (C1) {$C_1$};
      \node[RV] at (2,1) (C2) {$C_2$};
      \draw[->] (A1) to (B);
      \draw[->] (A2) to (B);
      \draw[->] (B) to (C1);
      \draw[->] (B) to (C2);
    \end{tikzpicture}
**** Network rule
:PROPERTIES:
:BEAMER_col: 0.5
:END:
If $A$ is a parent of $B$ and $C$ is a child of $B$, and there are *no other paths* from $A$ to $C$ then the following conditional independence holds:
\[
P(C \mid B, A) = P(C \mid B)
\]
i.e. $C$ is conditionally independent of $A$ given $B$. 
**** Conditional probability tables
We can now write the distribution of the above example as
\[
P( B, C_1, C_2) = 
P(A_1) P(A_2) P(B | A_1 \cap A_2) P(C_1 | B) P(C_2 | B).
\]

**** Details
- Probability of each world $A_i$ being true: 1/4
- Probability of each hole generating a breeze: $P(B_1 | A_2 \cup A_4) = P(B_2 | A_3 \cup A_4)$ with $B_1, B_2$ conditionally independent given $A$.
**** Questions
- What is the probability of feeling a breeze $B = B_1 \cup B_2$ in each world? 
- What is the probability of a hole above if you *feel* a breeze?
- What is the probability of a hole above f you *don't* feel a breeze?

*** Example: The k-meteorologists problem
- A set of stations $\Param$, with $\param \in \Param$ making weather predictions:
  \[
  P_\param(x_{t+1} \mid x_1, \ldots, x_{t})
  \]
- A *prior probability* $P(\param)$ on the stations.
- The *marginal* probability
\[
P(x_1, \ldots, x_t) = \sum_{\param \in \Param} P_\param(x_1, \ldots, x_t) P(\param)
\]
- The *posterior* probability
\begin{align*}
P(\param \mid x_1, \ldots, x_t)
&= \frac{P_\param(x_1, \ldots, x_t) P(\param)}{P(x_1, \ldots, x_t)}
= \frac{\prod_{i=1}^t P_\param(x_t \mid x_1, \ldots, x_{t-1})  P(\param)}{P(x_1, \ldots, x_t)}\\
&= \frac{P_\param(x_t \mid x_1, \ldots, x_{t-1})  P(\param \mid x_1, \ldots, x_{t-1})}{P(x_t \mid x_1, \ldots, x_{t-1})}

\]

* Statistical Decision Theory
  #+TOC: headlines [currentsection]
** Elementary Decision Theory
*** Preferences
**** Types of rewards                                               :example:
- For e.g. a student: Tickets to concerts.
- For e.g. an investor: A basket of stocks, bonds and currency.
- For everybody: Money.

**** Preferences among rewards
For any rewards $x, y \in R$, we either
- (a) Prefer $x$ at least as much as $y$ and write $x \preceq^* y$.
- (b) Prefer $x$ not more than $y$ and write $x \succeq^* y$.
- (c) Prefer $x$ about the same as $y$ and write $x \eqsim^* y$.
- (d) Similarly define $\succ^*$ and $\prec^*$
  
*** Utility and Cost
**** Utility function
To make it easy, assign a utility $U(x)$ to every reward through a
utility function $U : R \to \Reals$.

**** Utility-derived preferences
We prefer items with higher utility, i.e.
- (a) $U(x) \geq U(y)$ $\Leftrightarrow$ $x \succeq^* y$
- (b) $U(x) \leq U(y)$ $\Leftrightarrow$ $y \succeq^* x$

**** Cost
     It is sometimes more convenient to define a cost function $C: R \to \Reals$ so that we prefer items with lower cost, i.e.
- $C(x) \geq C(y)$ $\Leftrightarrow$ $y \succeq^* x$

*** Random outcomes
**** Choosing among rewards
-[A] Bet 10 CHF on black
-[B] Bet 10 CHF on 0
-[C] Bet nothing
What is the reward here?

**** Choosing among trips
-[A] Taking the car to Zurich (50' without delays, 80' with delays)
-[B] Taking the train to Zurich (60' without delays)
What is the reward here? 

**** Random rewards
- Each gamble gives us different rewards with different probabilities.
- These rewards are then *random*
- For simplicity, we assign a real-valued *utility* to outcomes. This is a *random variable*
** Random variables, expectation and variance
*** Random variables
A random variable $f : \Omega \to \Reals$ is a real-valued *function*, with $\omega \sim P$.
**** The distribution of $f$
The probability that $f$ lies in some subset $A \subset \Reals$ is
\[
P_f(A) \defn P(\{\omega \in \Omega : f(\omega) \in A\}),
\]
and we write $f \sim P_f$. 
**** Shorthands for RV
- For RVs $f : \Omega \to \Reals$, we can write $P(f \in A)$ to mean $P_f(A)$.
- For RVs $f : \Omega \to X$, where $X$ is a finite set e.g. $\{1, 2, \ldots, n\}$, we can write $P(f = x)$ for any $x \in X$.
**** Independence
Two RVs $f,g$ are independent in the same way that events are independent:
\[
P(f \in A \wedge g \in B) = P(f \in A) P(g \in B) = P_f(A) P_g(B).
\]
In that sense, $f \sim P_f$ and $g \sim P_g$.


*** Expectation
For any real-valued random variable $f: \Omega \to \Reals$, the expectation with respect to a probability measure $P$ is
\[
\E_P(f) = \sum_{\omega \in \Omega} f(\omega) P(\omega).
\]
When $\Omega$ is continuous, we can use a density $p$
\[
\E_P(f) = \int_{\Omega} f(\omega) p(\omega) d\omega.
\]
**** Linearity of expectations
For any RVs $x, y$:
\[
\E_P(x + y) = \E_P(x) + \E_P(y)
\]
*** Multiple variables
**** The joint distribution $P(x,y)$
For two (or more) RVs $x : \Omega \to \Reals$, and $y : \Omega \to
 \Reals$, this is a *shorthand* for the distribution of $(x(\omega),
 y(\omega))$ when $\omega \sim P$. We can also use $P(x = i, y = j)$ for the probability that the two variables assume the values $i, j$ respectively.
**** Independence
If $x,y$ are independent RVs then $P(x,y) = P_x(x) P_y(y)$.
**** Correlation
If $x,y$ are *not* correlated then $\E_P(xy) = \E(x)\E(y)$.
**** IID (Independent and Identically Distributed) random variables
A sequence $x_t$ of r.v.s is IID if $x_t \sim P$
so that
\[
(x_1, \ldots, x_t, \ldots, x_T) \sim P^T
\]
i.e. a \(T\)-length sample is drawn from the product distribution $P^T = P \times P \times \cdots \times P$.
*** Conditional expectation
The conditional expectation of a random variable $f: \Omega \to \Reals$, with respect to a probability measure $P$ conditioned on some event $B$ is simply
\[
\E_P(f | B) = \sum_{\omega \in \Omega} f(\omega) P(\omega | B).
\]
Conditional expectations are similar to conditional probabilities.
*** Conditional probabilities of RVs
Similarly to the notation over sets,
\[
P(A \cap B) = P(A \mid B) P(B),
\]
when dealing with RVs, it is common to use the notation
\[
P(x, y) = P(x | y) P(y)
\]
This equation works for all possible values of $x, y$ e.g.
\[
P(x = 1, y = 0) = P(x = 1 | y = 0) P(y = 0)
\]
which then denotes the probability msas of each

** Statistical Decision Theory

*** Expected utility
**** Actions, outcomes and utility
In this setting, we obtain random outcomes that depend on our actions.
- Actions $a \in A$
- Outcomes $\omega \in \Omega$.
- Probability of outcomes $P(\omega \mid a)$
- Utility $U : \Omega \to \Reals$
**** Expected utility
The expected utility of an action is:
\[
\E_P[U \mid a] = \sum_{\omega \in \Omega} U(\omega) P(\omega \mid a).
\]

**** The expected utility hypothesis
We prefer $a$ to $a'$ if and only if
\[
\E_P[U \mid a] \geq \E_P[U \mid a']
\]

*** The St-Petersburg Paradox
**** The game
If you give me $x$ CHF, then I promise to
(a) Throw a fair coin until it comes heads.
(b) If it does so after $T$ throws, then I will give you $2^T$ CHF.
**** The question
- How much $x$ are you willing to pay to play?
- Given that the expected amount of money is infinite, why are you only willing to pay a small $x$?

*** Example: Betting
 In this example, probabilities reflect actual randomness

| Choice     | Win Probability $p$ | Payout $w$ | Expected gain |

What are the expected gains for these bets?
*** Example: Route selection
- In this example, probabilities reflect subjective beliefs

|--------------+-----------+-----------------+--------------+---------------|
| Choice       | Best time | Chance of delay | Delay amount | Expected time |
|--------------+-----------+-----------------+--------------+---------------|
| Train        |        80 | 5%              |            5 |               |
| Car, route A |        60 | 50%             |           30 |               |
| Car, route B |        70 | 10%             |           10 |               |
|--------------+-----------+-----------------+--------------+---------------|

*** Example: Estimation
- In this example, probabilities are calculated starting from subjective beliefs
**** Mean-Square Estimation
If we want to guess $\hat{\param}$, and we knew that $\param \sim P$, then the guess
\[
\hat{\param} = \E_P(\param) = \argmin_{\hat{\param}} \E_P [(\param - \hat{\param})^2]
\]

*** Example: The k-meteorologists problem
- A set of stations $\Param$, with $\param \in \Param$ making weather predictions:
  \[
  P_\param(x_{t+1} \mid x_1, \ldots, x_{t})
  \]
- A *prior probability* $P(\param)$ on the stations.
- The *marginal* probability
\[
P(x_1, \ldots, x_t) = \sum_{\param \in \Param} P_\param(x_1, \ldots, x_t) P(\param)
\]
- The *posterior* probability
\begin{align*}
P(\param \mid x_1, \ldots, x_t)
&= \frac{P_\param(x_1, \ldots, x_t) P(\param)}{P(x_1, \ldots, x_t)}
= \frac{\prod_{i=1}^t P_\param(x_t \mid x_1, \ldots, x_{t-1})  P(\param)}{P(x_1, \ldots, x_t)}\\
&= \frac{P_\param(x_t \mid x_1, \ldots, x_{t-1})  P(\param \mid x_1, \ldots, x_{t-1})}{P(x_t \mid x_1, \ldots, x_{t-1})}
\end{align*}
- The *marginal posterior* probability
\[
P(x_{t+1} \mid x_1, \ldots, x_t) = \sum_{\param \in \Param} P_\param(x_{t+1} \mid x_1, \ldots, x_t) P(\param \mid x_1, \ldots, x_t)
\]
